Looking to contribute something to state.cs? **Here's how you can help.**

## JavaScript

I am a complete JavaScript novice; please help improve the quality of the code...

## Reporting issues

We only accept issues that are bug reports or feature requests.
Bugs must be isolated and reproducible problems that we can fix within the state.cs core.
Please read the following guidelines before opening any issue.

1. **Search for existing issues.** You'd help us out a lot by first checking if someone else has reported the same issue. Moreover, the issue may have already been resolved with a fix available.
2. **Create an isolated and reproducible test case.** Be sure the problem exists in state.cs's code with a reduced test case that should be included in each bug report.
3. **Share as much information as possible.** Include operating system version, version of state.cs, customized or vanilla build, etc. where appropriate. Also include steps to reproduce the bug.

## Key branches
